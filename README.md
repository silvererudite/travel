# A Simple Full-stack app for travel bloggers
This is originally intended as a personal project where I implement things as I learn particularly CSS. 
I will first use **CSS flexbox** to give the page a basic layout. Then I would refactor and/or integrate *CSS Grid* as I learn it.
The plan is to first design and implement the UI. Then provide backend functionality using *python flask* .
